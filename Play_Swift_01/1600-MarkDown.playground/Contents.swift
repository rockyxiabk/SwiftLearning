/**
 In this playground, I will show you how to use swift built-in comment syntac to create documentation. It's quite useful when your program is large or you need to share your code to co-works.
 
 Basically speaking, you can use the /** ... */ for mutiline comments or /// for single-line comments. Inside comment blcoks, basic **Markdown** syntax applied:
 
 - Paragraphs are seperated by blank lines
 - Unordered lists can use a variety of bullet characters: -, +, *. This sample is in an unordered list.
 - Ordered lists use Arabic numerals followed by a period 1., as follows
 
 1. item 1
 2. item 2
 3. item 3
 
 ```
 let a = "Hello"
 let b = "Swift"
 print( a + ", " + b )
 ```

/// # Headline
/// ## Headline
/// - You can use `#` or `##` to headline the title or subtitle. Underlining by `=` or `-` also works. But the representation is quite ugly for me, so I never use them.
/// - You can use `*` or `_` to make emphasis like *this* and _this_.
/// - You can also use `**` to make text strong or bold like **this**
/// - You can use the links syntax. Whelcome to [imooc](http://imooc.com).
/// - You can use the images syntax. This is an example. ![Swift logo](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/Swift-Comment-Documentation-Tutorial/blob/master/images/swift.png?raw=true)
